# Chime AI Chat Application API Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the available API endpoints, including details on how to use them, the required request parameters, sample requests, and expected responses. The API is built with Laravel and supports JWT authentication, conversation management, AI chat interactions (including streaming responses), and administrative actions for super admins.


## 1. Overview

The Chime AI Chat Application enables users to engage in AI-powered conversations. It supports multiple AI providers and various models, gives real-time streaming responses, and offers role-based access control.

**Key Features:**
- User Authentication (Login, Register, Logout, Token Refresh)
- Conversation Management (Create, List, Show, Delete)
- Chat Messaging (Text, Attachments, Streaming responses)
- AI Models Listing and Customization
- Super Admin Functions (Provider and Model Management)
- Rate Limiting and CORS Protection


## 2. Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. For example, if your domain is `http://localhost`, the full URL for login is:
```
http://localhost/api/login
```


## 3. Authentication

The API uses JWT tokens for authentication. Once you log in or register, you will receive a token. Include this token in the `Authorization` header for all protected endpoints.

**Header Example:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```

## 7. Error Handling

The API provides consistent error responses:

- **401 Unauthorized:** When authentication fails or a valid JWT is not provided.
- **403 Forbidden:** When the user is not allowed to access the requested resource.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity:** For validation errors. The response includes details about which fields failed.
- **429 Too Many Requests:** When rate limits are exceeded (60 requests per minute).
- **500 Internal Server Error:** For general or unexpected errors.

**Example Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed.",
  "errors": {
    "email": ["The email field is required."]
  }
}
```


## 8. Additional Notes

- **File Attachments:**  
  Chat endpoints support file attachments. These files are processed according to their type (e.g., TXT, PDF) and appended to the chat message.

- **Provider Selection:**  
  The API uses the provided or default AI model to select the appropriate provider. The `AIService` automatically determines which provider instance to use based on the model requested.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  API requests are limited to 60 per minute for each user (or IP for unauthenticated requests). Exceeding the limit will result in a 429 response.

- **Database Seeding:**  
  The initial setup creates a super admin (email: `admin@chime.ai`, password: `admin@2024`) and seeds AI providers and models. Run:
  ```bash
  php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
  ```
  to set up the database.
